## Inspiration
Get Tech news delivered to your mail inbox  
In our fast-paced lives, it can be difficult to keep up with the news by constantly browsing channels or websites. To address this, we have developed a project that collects tech news from various sources, condenses the information, and delivers it straight to your email inbox using the Courier API. #TechNewsViaCourier

## What it does
The project gathers tech news information from websites through webscraping, then summarizes and delivers the information to your email inbox using the Courier API.

FLOW:

DATABRICKS(Python) ---**REST API**---> NEWS WEBSITES(source) ------> WEB SCRAPING ------> SUMMARIZED NEWS ---**COURIER API**---> MAIL INBOX


## How we built it
The project was developed using Python code on the Databricks platform, and the Courier API was utilized to connect to your email inbox.

## Challenges we ran into
Obtaining reliable news and presenting it accurately through web scraping was a difficult task.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The challenges are tackled and successfully developed the product.

## What we learned
Webscraping: How to extract data from websites and web pages.
Data cleaning: How to clean and preprocess the extracted data.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): How to use NLP techniques to extract meaningful information from text data.
API integration: How to integrate with third-party APIs such as the Courier API to deliver data.
Workflow automation: How to automate the workflow using platforms like Databricks to increase efficiency and productivity.

## What's next for World News via Courier
Adding more news sources: Currently, the project collects news from a limited number of sources. Adding more news sources would provide a wider range of news for users to read.
Customizing news delivery: Adding an option for users to select the type of news they want to receive or customizing the news delivery based on the user's location and preferences could enhance the user experience.
Integrating with social media: Integrating the project with social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook would allow users to share news articles and stay up-to-date on the latest news.
User feedback: Gathering user feedback to identify any areas for improvement and implementing those suggestions could make the project more user-friendly and enhance the user experience.
